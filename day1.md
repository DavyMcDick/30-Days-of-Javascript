# 📘 My JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal documentation of learning JavaScript from beginner to advanced level.

## 📅 Day 1 – April 1, 2025

---

### 🧠 Topics Covered
- ✅ Variables (`let`, `const`, `var`)
- ✅ Data Types
- ✅ Operators

---

### 📦 What is Variables?

> A variable is like a container that stores data — like a box with a label on it. You can put something in it (like a name, number, or list), and use it later in your program.

#### 🔹 There are 3 ways to declare variables:
- `var` → (older way)  
- `let` → (most common used)  
- `const` → (value that can't change)

#### 💡 Example:
```javascript
var name = "David";
let age = 21;
const country = "Philippines";
```

---

### 🧊 What is Data Types?

> Data types describe the kind of value a variable can hold.

#### 🔸 1. Primitive Data Types
- **String** → `"Hello"`
- **Number** → `21`
- **Boolean** → `true` or `false`
- **Undefined**
- **Null**
- **BigInt** → `12345678n`
- **Symbol** → `Symbol("id")`

#### 🔸 2. Non-Primitive Data Types
- **Object** → `{ name: David, age: 21 }`
- **Array** → `["hello", "apple", "bananq"]`
- **Function** → `function() {}`
### Example
```javascript
let name = "David";
let age = 21;
let male = true;
let status;
let life = null;
let money = 100,000,000.00;
```

### ⚙️ Operation

> An operation is an action that performs something on one or more values (called operands) using operators.

---

#### ➕ 1. Arithmetic Operations
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulo, Exponent  
**Operators:** `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`

---

#### 🧮 2. Assignment Operations
**Operators:** `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`

---

#### 🧪 3. Comparison Operations
- `==`  
- `===`  
- `!=`  
- `>`  
- `<`  
- `<=`  
- `>=`

---

#### 🔗 4. Logical Operations
- `&&` → and  
- `||` → or  
- `!` → not

---

### ✅ What I Learned
- Difference between `let` and `var`
- Template literals
- Basic arithmetic operations

---

### ❓ Challenges
- Forgot about scope with `let` vs `var`
- Mixed `==` and `===`
